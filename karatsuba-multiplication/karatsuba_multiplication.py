# To get the most out of this assignment, your program should restrict itself to multiplying only pairs of single-digit numbers.  
# You can implement the grade-school algorithm if you want, but to get the most out of the assignment you'll want to implement recursive 
# integer multiplication and/or Karatsuba's algorithm.
